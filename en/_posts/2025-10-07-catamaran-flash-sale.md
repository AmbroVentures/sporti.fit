## 🚨 This Is Your Last Chance

**The event starts THIS FRIDAY.** And somehow, impossibly, we still have a few precious spots left on what might be the most unique indoor cycling experience you'll ever have.

Picture this: **Saturday morning. A luxury catamaran. The Mediterranean sparkling beneath you. And your bike.**

Not in a studio. Not in a gym. On the open water, with the Costa del Sol as your backdrop, the sun on your face, and the ocean breeze pushing you forward.

### ⛵ The Catamaran Experience

**Saturday, October 11th - 10:00 AM**  
📍 Departing from Muelle Uno, Málaga

This isn't just a ride. It's a 3-hour journey that combines:

- **Two intense 1-hour cycling sessions** led by our top international trainers:
  - 10:10 AM with Alex, Attilio & Robbie
  - 11:30 AM with David, João, Beppe & Robbie
- **Mediterranean sailing** between sessions
- **Heartful lunch** at O Mamma Mia afterward (included in full-day ticket)
- **Unparalleled views** you cannot get anywhere else

The bikes are secured. The music is curated. The energy will be electric. All that's missing is you.

## ⚡ 48-HOUR FLASH SALE

**30% OFF all Catamaran tickets**

🎫 **Use code:** `SEASPRINT30`  
⏰ **Valid until:** Tuesday, October 8th, 23:59

### Why This Matters

Look, we could tell you this is about "limited availability" or "exclusive opportunity." But here's the truth: we want that catamaran FULL. We want the energy maxed out. We want you there.

Some of our community grabbed their tickets months ago. They're ready. They're packed. They're counting down the days.

But if you've been on the fence, if you've been thinking "maybe," if you've been waiting for a sign...

**This is it. This is the sign.**

## The Bottom Line

We're two days away from an event that's been months in the making. The catamaran is booked. The instructors are ready. The playlist is fire.

All systems are GO.

Except we need YOU there to make it complete.

**30% off. 48 hours. Limited spots.**

See you on the water. ⛵
