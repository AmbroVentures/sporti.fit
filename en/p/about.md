Thank you for visiting Sporti.fit! We're excited to share information about us and our upcoming events, although some sections of our website are still under construction.

Welcome to our science-based SPORTI cycling training program. If you're looking to improve your cycling performance and take advantage of the benefits of indoor training, you're in the right place. In this essay, we'll explore how the science-based SPORTI indoor cycling method can help you achieve your goals and improve in the sport you love so much.

### Development

First, it's important to understand why indoor cycling can be an effective option for improving your performance. Unlike outdoor training, where you're subject to weather conditions and terrain, indoor cycling offers you a controlled and consistent environment. This allows you to focus on specific aspects of training, such as controlling your cadence, endurance, and power.

One of the fundamental principles behind the science-based SPORTI indoor cycling method is interval training. This approach is based on alternating periods of high intensity with periods of active recovery, which helps increase your cardiovascular endurance and improve your ability to maintain high speeds for longer periods.

Additionally, the use of advanced technology in indoor cycling, such as heart rate monitors and power meters, provides you with accurate information about your performance. This allows you to make specific adjustments to your training and maximize your results. By analyzing your data, you'll be able to identify your strengths and weaknesses, enabling you to design a personalized and efficient training plan.

Another important aspect to consider is the comfort and convenience that indoor cycling offers. You can train at any time of day, regardless of the weather outside. Additionally, you can adapt your training sessions according to your availability and fitness level. This makes it easier to maintain a consistent routine and commit to your development as a cyclist.

### Conclusion

In summary, training with the science-based SPORTI indoor cycling method can be highly beneficial for improving your cycling performance. The combination of a controlled environment, interval training, and the use of advanced technology will allow you to achieve your goals more effectively and efficiently.

So don't wait any longer, join SPORTI our training program and discover how you can take your cycling to the next level. We're here to guide you, motivate you, and support you every step of the way. Get ready to experience a new level of success in your cycling career!

## In-Person Classes

#### The Structure of Our Classes
We begin with an appropriate warm-up for each class, structured according to the FTP (Functional Threshold Power) objective. A central part, structured for each different objective we want to achieve in a progression, taking into account load and rest times. A cool-down and appropriate stretching.

The first thing we need to do to extrapolate the data is identify our FTP (Functional Threshold Power), which is equal to the Functional Power Threshold.

In the first week of practicing classes, we can define our power curve and obtain an initial baseline for the following tests we perform: the VO2max test, the FTP test, the maximum peak test, and the submaximal peak test. This series of tests will give us a first idea of our physical condition and categorize us into one of the following phenotypes: Sprinter, Pursuiter, All-rounder, or Time Trialist.

#### Training Levels
Training requires the relationship between time and fatigue, and this can be divided into four groups according to the dominant metabolism that supplies energy to the muscles:

**Neuromuscular Power**: 5-15 seconds. The lacto-anaerobic metabolism is the basic energy system that ensures motor activity (phosphagen system). Heart Rate N/A (The effort is so short that the heart rate monitor doesn't reach it) / FTP 121% to 140%

**Anaerobic Power**: 30 seconds to 2 minutes. High-intensity motor activity is mainly supplied with energy by the lactate-anaerobic system (anaerobic glycolysis). Heart Rate N/A (The effort is so short that the heart rate monitor doesn't reach it) / FTP between 106% and 120%.

**VO2max**: 3-8 minutes. From this period onwards, the aerobic system is dominant, but the portion of anaerobic lactate metabolism can still be large (anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis). Heart Rate 90-100% and FTP 106% and 120%

**Tempo / Endurance**: Approximately 10 minutes to several hours. Motor activity is guaranteed by the aerobic energy system of more than 90% (oxidative system). Heart Rate 70-90% and FTP 75% and 105%

These power-frequency duration models will help us understand not only the general relationship between time and exhaustion, but also how to train to create maximum results and the necessary adaptation to improve our weaknesses.

#### Determining Cyclist Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and Improvement Opportunities
All cyclists have strengths and weaknesses. When working to improve training and competitive performance, it's important to correctly identify strengths and weaknesses, and use this knowledge to maximize and design training focused on them and define race strategy. The Power Duration model provides numerous ways to review and identify strengths and weaknesses, and the simplest method is phenotype.

What is a phenotype? It's composed of physiological characteristics and observable individual sources of a cyclist such as peak power, time to exhaustion, and functional threshold power, expressed by grouping individuals with similar characteristics. Cyclists can be divided into four general phenotypes:

##### 1. The Sprinter
These athletes have a greater amount of fast-twitch muscle fibers and excellent ability to produce force on the pedals in a very short period of time (less than 30 seconds). They can be "explosive," with incredible peak power in the first 5 seconds. A sprinter can also be more of a "diesel" sprinter with the ability to maintain very high power for up to 20-30 seconds. Example: Andre Greipel, Mark Cavendish, Robbie McEwen.

##### 2. The Pursuiter or The Breakaway Artist
These athletes have great power and naturally high VO2Max and can produce high watts for approximately 3 to 8 minutes. They can usually produce 120+% of their FTP power for 5 minutes, which is above the upper limit of classic Coggan levels for Level 5 (VO2max). Example: Thor Hushovd, Philippe Gilbert, Peter Sagan.

##### 3. The All-Rounder
These athletes have a fairly uniform mix of fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers. They may have a very good sprint (5-15 seconds) and can do a good time trial for an hour with high FTP. They perform well in almost all events; they're not the big favorites, but they're always a threat to win. An important thing to remember about all-rounders is that they also have the ability to "change" phenotype based on their training focus. An all-rounder could spend a year working on improving their pursuit and become a Pursuiter, and the next year work on climbing and then become a Time Trialist. This is very common among all-rounders. Example: Chris Froome, Eddy Merckx, Richie Porte, Alejandro Valverde.

##### 4. The Time Trialist
These athletes typically have a large percentage of slow-twitch muscle fibers and high FTP, but with little neuromuscular power. They can maintain their power for a long time (more than 30 minutes) and show excellent endurance for many hours. They excel in stage races, gran fondos, time trials, climbing, and any event that requires a long, hard, and sustained effort. Example: Cadel Evans, Tony Martin, Bradley Wiggins.
